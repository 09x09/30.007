Microcontroller Selection and Evaluation 
V1 by Xavier, 12th Feb 2019




  ODROID C2 bought 12th Feb 2019, receive date TBC
  Linux to be installed on C2, communicate with microcontrollers (Arduino) via serial
  
  Parts:
    - Motors/Motor Drivers
        Power input by external sources USB/Rechargeable Batteries
        System can be controlled via PWM by Arduino Nano into L298N Motor Drivers
        Type of Motor TBC for 
    - Navigation (LIDAR/RADAR)
        Inputs fed into Arduino Mega to be able to handle data load and compute responses
    - Sensor Inputs
        Inputs into Arduino Mega to be able to handle data load
